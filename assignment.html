<h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b></h1>
<p><br></p>
<p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
<ul>
  <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.3 of Lab 1</li>
  <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
  <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
  <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
assignment tasks.</li>
  <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
  <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
  <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
  <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>3.0 Part 3 Tasks</b></h1>
<h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
<p>Following are some of my reflections and ideas during buiding this website.</p>
<p>1. Start a prototype as early as possible. I started to create the prototype as the assignment was released. In this way I clearly understand the topic that I want to design and it helped me gather more information and make necessary adjustments before I invested too much time and effort.</p>
<p>2. Consider its interactive when design. As I developed my website more comprehensive, I found the original design was too hard to interact, and I thought the design should be more detail and comprehensive, so I have to refactoring it and start again. It took a lot of effort doing that.</p>
<p>3. Always ready to Iterate and Start Over. I think building a website is a journey, and it's okay to realize that my initial design if it isn't working as well as I thought. Sometimes I have to step back and make the necessary changes. It felt really frustrating, but starting again can lead to a better end result.</p>
<p>4. Stay Organized: I've learned the hard way to keep me code readable and well organized. At first the neatness of the code troubled me for a long time since I could not bear the chaos of the comment and code and I always could not find the code that I wanted to check. So I started learning and borrowing from others' code structures and sorting online, and found the code style that suits me and added clear annotations, which made me very satisfied with the completion of this project.</p>
<h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
<a href="me.html#dark-mode-toggle">Dark Mode Toggle - Me Page</a><br>
<a href="index.html#dark-mode-toggle">Dark Mode Toggle - Index Page</a><br>
<a href="feedback.html#dark-mode-toggle">Dark Mode Toggle - Feedback Page</a><br>
<p>The "Toggle Dark Mode" button allows users to manually switch between the default and dark mode stylesheets.</p>
<p>Additionally, it will change the default css according to current time.</p>
<h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s)</b></h2>
<a href="me.html#socialButtons">Social Button - Facebook & Linked in</a><br>
<p>Also used in footer section in all this pages.</p>
<h2><b>3.4 Social Networking Feed(s)</b></h2>
<a href="me.html#instagramButton">Social Feed - Instagram</a><br>

<h2><b>3.5 CSS and HTML Validation</b></h2>
<p>Validator for all html and css files:</p>
<div class="pdf-container">
    <iframe src="Validator_css_html.pdf" width="800" height="600"></iframe>
</div>
<h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
<a href="assets/js/darkmode.js">Dark Mode Toggle change automatically  - Javascript</a><br>
